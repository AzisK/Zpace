# Zpace 

A CLI tool to discover what's hogging your disk space!

The tool shows the largest files in each category of files (videos, pictures, documents etc.) as well as the largest special directories as apps in MacOS, Python virtual environments, node_modules etc.

It's built to indentify the biggest chunks of that could potentially up the space for something else.

## Usage

### Basic Commands
```bash
# Scan your home directory (default)
zpace

# Scan a specific directory
zpace /path/to/directory

# Scan current directory
zpace .
```

### Options
```bash
# Show top 20 items per category (default: 10)
zpace -n 20

# Set minimum file size to 1MB (default: 100KB)
zpace -m 1024

# Combine options
zpace ~/Documents -n 15 -m 500
```
